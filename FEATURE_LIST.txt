FEATURE LIST – Asset Management Software

1. Understanding of Client Requirements

The client requires a software system to manage and track company-owned
assets such as laptops, monitors, mobile phones, and other office
equipment.

The primary goal of the system is to clearly identify which asset is
assigned to which employee at any given time. This helps improve
accountability, minimize asset loss, and make internal asset tracking
more organized within the company.


2. Creative Freedoms Taken in the Project

Since detailed specifications were not fully defined, the following
assumptions and design choices were made:

- The product is named “TrackIT – Company Asset Manager”
- The system is designed as a web-based internal application
- The initial scope focuses only on asset tracking and assignment
- The system is kept simple and scalable to allow future feature additions
- The software is primarily intended for admin or IT department usage


3. Assumptions Made About Client Requirements

To design the system effectively, the following assumptions were
considered:

- Each asset has a unique identifier or serial number
- Employees are registered in the system before asset assignment
- An asset can be assigned to only one employee at a time
- Only authorized users can add, update, or assign assets
- Internet connectivity is available within the organization
- The system will be used by a single organization


4. Feature List

1. Asset Registration  
Admins can register new assets by entering details such as asset type,
serial number, purchase date, and current condition.

2. Employee Management

ID, name, department, and contact information.

3. Asset Assignment

date and ownership status.

4. Asset Return Tracking  
Provides the option to mark assets as returned and automatically update
their availability status.

5. Asset Status Dashboard  
Displays an overview of all assets, showing whether they are available,
assigned, or under maintenance.

6. Assignment History  
Maintains a complete history of asset assignments for tracking,
auditing, and reference purposes.

7. Search and Filter  
Makes it easy to locate assets using filters such as asset type, serial
number, employee name, or current status.


5. Questions for the Next Client Meeting

- Which types of assets should be tracked in the initial phase?
- Approximately how many assets and employees will the system handle?
- Who should have access to the system (admin, manager, employee)?
- Is role-based access control required?
- Should asset condition and maintenance history be recorded?
- Are reports or export options (PDF or Excel) needed?
- Is mobile or tablet access expected?
